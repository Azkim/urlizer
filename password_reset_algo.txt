User enters email and posts a hidden token plus email

System checks if email matches any available emails in DB...if available, the system saves (overwrites) the email, timestamp and token...if the emails do not match the system throws an error requesting for the correct email.

On saving the details on DB, the system emails back EU a token of format...http://www.domain?token=token

On opening this link on a new tab...the system GETS the token value and compares it with the token saved it on the DB...if match exists the system allows a user to update using password_hash() encryption algo...if no match, the system will throw an error and redirect the user to the password reset page

If the user delays in hour to open link, then on clicking the link and server request time is beyond 60 mins, then the system should thrown an error and redirected user back to password reset page
